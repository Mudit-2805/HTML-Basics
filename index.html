    <h1>A Deatailed plan that I will probably fail to follow</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>What I want to do with HTML</h2>
    <p>My plan for the summer is to learn the basics of Web-Dev and become an intermediate in it,
        The plan is to learn the bascis and then continue over the summer and make multiple Websites using html, css, js and react.
        <br> This is how I plan on doing it :-
        <ul>
            <li>Learn HTML</li>
            <li>Learn CSS</li>
            <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
            <li>Make a basic Website</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Ideas for my first few Websites</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To-Do list (because every tutorial said so)</li>
        <li>Personal Website</li>
        <li>Something like Insta</li>
        <li>Amazon Ripoff</li>
        <li>Tinder for Clothes</li>
    </ol>
